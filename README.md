This project aims to keep an organised check on states of the book mainly-
* ### Currently Reading-
    Books which are currently being read by you and have not completed
* ### Want to read-
    Books which are in the back of your head and want to get a hand on them as soon as possible.
* ### read-
    Books which have already been read by you

The main page also includes a button to navigate to the source page where you can find various other books on the basis of your search.

You can then shift those books into your shelves by categorizing them acoording to the status of the completion of the books.
